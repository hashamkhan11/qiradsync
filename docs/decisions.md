## 2026-10-02 — First response wins, not reject wins

**Decision:** For every needs-approval record, only each partner's first `approve`/`reject`
(lowest `seq`) targeting it counts. Later responses from the same author to the same target are
kept as evidence but ignored in calculations, shown in the UI as "ignored: later response." To
change their mind, a partner must create a new proposal, not a new response. Replaces the earlier
"reject wins over approve" rule.

**Reason:** "Reject wins" let a late-arriving reject flip an already-active decision back to dead
(for example, a ratio change both partners had already relied on). Decisions must be monotonic:
pending → active or pending → dead, never backward. The first-response rule is deterministic across
devices because the hash-chain/pending-buffer rule (spec §6.1 step 4) already forces every device to
evaluate an author's records in the same `seq` order, regardless of network arrival order.

## 2026-10-02 — Sync loop must not trust a cached relay vector

**Decision:** The client sync loop (spec §7.3) no longer decides "sync is finished" based on a
locally remembered belief about what the relay holds. Every sync, the client checks the relay's
*freshly returned* vector against its own local vector, for every author it holds records for
(including the other partner's). If the relay is missing anything, the client uploads the gap
immediately, in another `sync` call, up to 3 attempts before falling back to normal retry/backoff.
Added a required test: wipe the relay's database, then sync — the relay must end up holding every
record that exists on either phone.

**Reason:** The old rule ("upload records above the relay's *last known* vector") is a stale-cache
bug: if the relay loses data (e.g. a database restore), the client's memory of what the relay has
doesn't shrink to match, so the client never re-uploads the records the relay lost — they're gone
for good even though a perfect copy still exists on the phone. The relay has no CRDT logic of its
own to notice or repair this (hard rule: the relay never interprets records), so only a client that
re-verifies against the relay's live state, every sync, can catch and fix it.
