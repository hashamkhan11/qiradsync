## 2026-10-02 — First response wins, not reject wins

**Decision:** For every needs-approval record, only each partner's first `approve`/`reject`
(lowest `seq`) targeting it counts. Later responses from the same author to the same target are
kept as evidence but ignored in calculations, shown in the UI as "ignored: later response." To
change their mind, a partner must create a new proposal, not a new response. Replaces the earlier
"reject wins over approve" rule.

**Reason:** "Reject wins" let a late-arriving reject flip an already-active decision back to dead
(for example, a ratio change both partners had already relied on). Decisions must be monotonic:
pending → active or pending → dead, never backward. The first-response rule is deterministic across
devices because the hash-chain/pending-buffer rule (spec §6.1 step 4) already forces every device to
evaluate an author's records in the same `seq` order, regardless of network arrival order.
